# Coordinator

## Concepts

A `Coordinator` is an object that manages iOS applications navigation flow while keeping `UIViewController`s separate and indipendent.

By itself a `Coordinator` is a simple object that holds references to others `Coordinator`s and to his parent coordinator (if available). To be able to manage a navigation flow a `Coordinator` must be of two types:

- `NavCoordinator`  
Holding a `UINavigationController`

- `TabCoordinator`  
Holding a `UITabBarController`

**What a `Coordinator` should do**
- Present `Coordinator`s
- Push a `UIViewController`/`UINavigationController`/`UTabBarController` of another `Coordinator`
- Create `Couple`s object
- Be invisible to `UIViewController`s and only known by `ViewModel`s

**What a `Coordinator` should not do**
- Make network remote calls
- Be a `Delegate` for `ViewModel`s/`UIViewController`s
